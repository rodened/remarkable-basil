APIVIS is a SaaS (Software as a Service) created by Ulf Svensson. After working with several low code/visual coding environments when creating AI and machine learning applications for customers he identified an oppurtunity gap that yet hadn't any good solution. He formed a small team with over 20 years experience in developing static Web Sites, DevOps, Cloud Server management, Javascript, Python and Machine Learning to build a SaaS that fills this gap. The rest is history..
